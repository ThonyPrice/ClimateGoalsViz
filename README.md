## Description
This project is course work for DH2321 - Information visualization. In the course we had a client at SEI, [Stockholm Environmental Institute](https://www.sei.org/) who tasked us with intuatively visualize the how the 13 Sustainable Development Goals, [SDGs](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) impacts each other. 

Equipped with this data for Sweden and Mongolia we created a web page that transform the data into a chord diagram to present the data in more intuatively. The tool is intended to be used by decision makers to give them a better understanding of the impact all climate targets when working towards one of them.

The project is currently viewable [https://yipeitu.github.io/IVIS18_ProjectFinal/](HERE)

## Implementation

The data was ported from Excel spreadshets to a Mongo database on Google Cloud. The visualizations are made with D3JS where data is queried from the database in JSON. The page utilizes HTML and (a lot) of CSS. It's currently hosted on github pages.
